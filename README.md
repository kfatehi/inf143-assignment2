double the size of the table by adding your own fictitious data (24 in total)

questions
1. Frequency/counting: How many students are in each major (in this class)?
2. Did major have any affect on the score? Which majors scored higher/lower?
3. Did standing have any affect on the score? Did sophomores or juniors do better?
4. Did having or lacking the prerequisite have an affect on the score?

for each question, explain in 1 to 3 sentences why the graphic is appropriate for answering that question. Also explain, using either the lectures or Ware, why your choice of colors is the best.

First, you should learn how to use D3 to do simple graphs. More challenging examples will come in later assignments. Second, you should learn to choose the best graphic for answering common questions. And third, you should learn to make wise selections of color for your graphs.

Prepare a .pdf for submission that contains the following: the expanded data table with your additional students, the graphs and corresponding sentences for each of the questions above, and the D3 code you used for each graph. Submit your .pdf in the appropriate DropBox on EEE. It is due by class time on Tuesday, April 26.
